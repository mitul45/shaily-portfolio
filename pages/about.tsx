        <p>
          Having my humble roots in Architecture, I love to build digital
          products that help users to have meaningful and pleasurable
          experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have always been fascinated with designing products that people can
          relate them with. Having worked in Architecture gives me the ability
          to work cross-functions and to look at the bigger picture and lead
          with it. I like to engage in work where attention to detail and
          precision matter a great deal.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a designer, hailing from India. Currently, settled down in the
          Netherlends since 4 years. I like to spend time with my family, read a
          book, or paint when I am not busy crafting digital experiences.
